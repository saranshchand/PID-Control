* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## Reflection

### PID Control Theory

The PID Control project was designed in order to be able to drive a car around the race track using Control Theory. The idea is to introduce a controller to continously correct the car's steering angle and speed based upon cross track error and speed difference respectively. As seen below, the controller consists of three components: Proportional error, Integral error, and Differential error. 

![PID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39423033/119905544-7355f480-bf1a-11eb-80b9-1d7b11148714.jpg)

The proportional gain of the controller is directly related to the error- resulting in a large value if the error is large (to try to reduce that error), and a small value if the error is small. By keeping direct track of the error with this gain, it is a very important parameter to tune.

The integral gain keeps track of the cross track error throughout by accumulating the error throughout. As a result, the value of the gain is relatively lower by a few order of magnitudes as a higher gain will cause unnecessary swerving and the slightest change in error could affect vehicle trajectory!

The final gain is the differential gain- this keeps track of the current and previous error- by taking their difference- this allows for the derivative gain to step in whenever the difference in error is large and make an impact by contributing the the PID total error calculation- acting as a damper. 

### PID Tuning

The final gains were chosen through a combination of manual tuning and Twiddle. I started off my manually tuning to get a feel of which range I should use twiddle to narrow down the selectable gains as twiddle test drives the PID gains and then alters its value to test another combination- this can get very expensive considering GPU hours are limited and there are a lot of variables at play. The final gains were narrowed down based upon the behavior of the vehicle around sharp turns- as gains that are too large, especially the differential gain, can cause the vehicle to oscillate around sharp turns resulting in uncomfortable and dangerous driving behavior.
